-- ============================================
-- FIX: Auto-generate sequential IDs per user (v6 - COMPLETE)
-- ============================================
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- ============================================
-- This creates IDs like: CAN1, CAN2, CAN3... and CL1, CL2, CL3...
-- Each user has their own sequence starting from 1
-- Handles foreign key constraints properly
-- ============================================

-- STEP 1: DROP ALL POLICIES
-- ============================================

-- STEP 2: DROP VIEWS
-- ============================================
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS matches_with_details CASCADE;

-- STEP 3: DROP FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
-- ============================================
ALTER TABLE matches DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS matches_candidate_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE matches DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS matches_client_id_fkey;

-- STEP 4: ALTER COLUMN TYPES TO TEXT
-- ============================================
ALTER TABLE candidates ALTER COLUMN id TYPE TEXT;
ALTER TABLE clients ALTER COLUMN id TYPE TEXT;
ALTER TABLE matches ALTER COLUMN candidate_id TYPE TEXT;
ALTER TABLE matches ALTER COLUMN client_id TYPE TEXT;

-- Remove defaults
ALTER TABLE candidates ALTER COLUMN id DROP DEFAULT;

-- STEP 5: CREATE MAPPING TABLES (OLD ID â†’ NEW ID)
-- ============================================
CREATE TEMP TABLE candidate_id_map AS

-- STEP 6: UPDATE MATCHES TABLE FIRST (USING MAPPING)
-- ============================================
UPDATE matches m

WHERE m.candidate_id = cm.old_id;

UPDATE matches m

-- STEP 7: UPDATE CANDIDATES AND CLIENTS
-- ============================================
UPDATE candidates c

FROM candidate_id_map cm
WHERE c.id = cm.old_id;

UPDATE clients cl
SET id = clm.new_id
FROM client_id_map clm
WHERE cl.id = clm.old_id;

-- STEP 8: RECREATE FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
-- ============================================
ALTER TABLE matches
  ADD CONSTRAINT matches_candidate_id_fkey
  FOREIGN KEY (candidate_id)
  REFERENCES candidates(id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE matches
  ADD CONSTRAINT matches_client_id_fkey
  FOREIGN KEY (client_id)
  REFERENCES clients(id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- STEP 9: CREATE AUTO-INCREMENT FUNCTIONS
-- ============================================
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_candidate_id()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  next_num INTEGER;
BEGIN
  IF NEW.id IS NULL OR NEW.id = '' THEN
    SELECT COALESCE(
      MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(id FROM 'CAN(\d+)') AS INTEGER)), 0
    ) + 1

    NEW.id := 'CL' || next_num;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- STEP 10: CREATE TRIGGERS
-- ============================================
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_candidate_id ON candidates;
CREATE TRIGGER set_candidate_id
  BEFORE INSERT ON candidates
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION generate_candidate_id();

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_client_id ON clients;
