### ✅ Frontend Code (I UPDATED THESE)
1. **Login/Signup Pages** - `/login` and `/signup` ✅
2. **Middleware Protection** - Auto-redirect to login if not authenticated ✅
3. **Logout Button** - Top-right corner on all pages ✅
4. **User Email Display** - Shows current user's email ✅

## 🧪 TEST MULTI-USER ISOLATION

### Test 1: Create Second Account

1. **Click "Sign Out"** (top-right)
2. **Sign up again** with different email: `user2@test.com`
3. **Add some candidates/clients**
4. **Sign out**
5. **Sign back in** as first user
6. ✅ **Expected**: You won't see user2's data!

### Test 2: Verify Data Separation

**User 1:**
- Add candidate: "John Smith"
- Add client: "ABC Dental"

**User 2:**
- Add candidate: "Jane Doe"
- Add client: "XYZ Dental"

**Result:**
- User 1 only sees John Smith + ABC Dental ✅
- User 2 only sees Jane Doe + XYZ Dental ✅
- Data is completely separated! ✅

## 🔒 How Row Level Security Works

**RLS (Row Level Security)** automatically filters all database queries by the logged-in user's ID.

**Example:**
```sql
-- When User 1 queries:
SELECT * FROM candidates;

-- Supabase automatically adds:
SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE user_id = 'user-1-uuid';

-- User 1 CANNOT see User 2's data - it's impossible!
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Users can ONLY see their own data
- ✅ Users can ONLY edit their own data
- ✅ Users can ONLY delete their own data
- ✅ No way to access another user's data (even if they try to hack!)

---

## 📊 What Data Is User-Specific?

| Table | User-Specific | How It Works |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **candidates** | ✅ Yes | Each candidate belongs to one user |
| **clients** | ✅ Yes | Each client belongs to one user |
| **matches** | ✅ Yes | Only shows matches from user's candidates/clients |
| **match_statuses** | ✅ Yes | Status markers belong to one user |
| **match_notes** | ✅ Yes | Notes belong to one user |

## 🔜 NEXT STEP: DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION

Your system is now ready to deploy and share with your team!

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Multi-user authentication complete"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your GitHub repo
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
   - Add environment variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Done!** Your app is live at `your-app.vercel.app`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "You must be logged in" error when adding data

**Problem:** User session expired

**Solution:**
1. Click "Sign Out"
2. Sign in again
3. Try adding data again

---

### Can see another user's data

**Problem:** RLS policies not applied correctly

**Solution:**
1. Check you ran `AUTH_STEP_2_ENABLE_RLS.sql`
2. Verify policies exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('candidates', 'clients', 'match_statuses', 'match_notes');
   ```

---

### "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Problem:** Trying to insert without `user_id` or `user_id` mismatch

**Solution:** This should not happen - all code has been updated. If it does:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Sign out and sign in again
3. Try again
