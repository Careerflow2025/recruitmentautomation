# ✅ AI MODEL ISSUE FIXED

## 🎯 THE REAL PROBLEM

**Error:** `404 model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

**Root Cause:** The model ID `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` was deprecated by Anthropic and is no longer available.

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### Changed Model ID

**File:** `src/lib/ai-service.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
const MODEL = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'; // DEPRECATED - Returns 404
```

**After:**
```typescript
const MODEL = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'; // ✅ CURRENT VALID MODEL
```

## ⚠️ IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Check These:

1. **Port Number:**
   - Server is now on **PORT 3004** (not 3003 or 3001)
   - Check terminal for: `Local: http://localhost:XXXX`
   - Use that exact URL

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
   - Or clear all browser cache

3. **Server Fully Started:**
   - Wait until terminal shows: `✓ Ready in X.Xs`
   - Then test

4. **Still 404 Error:**
   - The model ID might have changed again
   - Check: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models
   - Look for latest Claude 3.5 Sonnet model ID
   - Update `MODEL` constant in `src/lib/ai-service.ts`
