# ‚úÖ AI FEATURE FIXED + COMPLETE TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### Problem
AI Chat was returning 500 error: "Failed to get answer from AI"

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Anthropic SDK Initialization**: Client was initialized at module load, before environment variables were available
2. **Error Handling**: Error messages weren't detailed enough to diagnose issues
3. **User Feedback**: Frontend didn't show helpful error messages

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Updated `src/lib/ai-service.ts` ‚úÖ
- Changed from static client to dynamic `getClient()` function
- Added API key validation on every call
- Better error messages for missing/invalid API keys

**Before:**
```typescript
const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY || '',
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const getClient = () => {
  const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
  if (!apiKey) {
    throw new Error('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set in environment variables');
  }
  if (!apiKey.startsWith('sk-ant-')) {
    throw new Error('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY appears to be invalid');
  }
  return new Anthropic({ apiKey });
};
```

#### 2. Updated `/api/ai/ask/route.ts` ‚úÖ
- Added detailed error categorization
- Shows specific errors for: API key missing, invalid key, rate limits
- Returns full error details in development mode

#### 3. Updated `AIChat.tsx` Component ‚úÖ
- Better error display for users
- User-friendly messages for common errors
- Console logging for debugging

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Error: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set"

**Problem:** Environment variable not loaded

**Solutions:**
1. **Check .env.local exists:**
   ```bash
   ls dental-matcher/.env.local
   ```
   Should show the file. If not, create it.

2. **Check API key is in file:**
   ```bash
   cat dental-matcher/.env.local | grep ANTHROPIC
   ```
   Should show: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...`

3. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   cd dental-matcher
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Verify port:**
   Server might be on different port (3001, 3003, etc.)
   Check terminal output for: `Local: http://localhost:XXXX`

---

### Error: "Invalid API Key"

**Problem:** API key is wrong or expired

**Solutions:**
1. **Get new API key:**
   - Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Sign in
   - Click "API Keys"
   - Create new key or copy existing one

2. **Update .env.local:**
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR-NEW-KEY-HERE
   ```

3. **Restart server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Error: "Failed to load resource: 500 (Internal Server Error)"

**Problem:** Server-side error

**Solutions:**
1. **Check server terminal:**
   Look for error messages in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for detailed error messages
   - Copy error and send to developer

3. **Restart server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Clear Next.js cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf dental-matcher/.next
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Error: "Rate Limit Exceeded"

**Problem:** Too many API calls too quickly

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait 1 minute** then try again
2. **Check your usage:**
   - Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Click "Usage"
   - See if you hit your limit

3. **Upgrade plan** if needed (unlikely - free tier is generous)

### Grammarly Extension Errors (Red in Console)

**Problem:** Browser extension conflicting

**Solutions:**
1. **Ignore them!** These errors are harmless:
   ```
   chrome-extension://kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen/...
   grm ERROR [RenderWithStyles]...
   ```

2. **These are from Grammarly browser extension**
   - They don't affect your app

## üí° COMMON MISTAKES

### ‚ùå Wrong Port
**Mistake:** Going to http://localhost:3000 when server is on 3003

**Fix:** Check terminal for actual port:
```
‚úì Ready in 3.7s
- Local:        http://localhost:3003  ‚Üê USE THIS PORT
```

### ‚ùå Not Logged In
**Mistake:** Trying to use AI without signing in first

**Fix:** Always sign in before using app features

### ‚ùå Server Not Restarted
**Mistake:** Adding API key to .env.local but not restarting server

**Fix:** Stop server (Ctrl+C) and restart (`npm run dev`)

### ‚ùå Wrong File Location
**Mistake:** Creating `.env.local` in wrong folder

**Fix:** File must be in `dental-matcher/` folder (same level as `package.json`)
