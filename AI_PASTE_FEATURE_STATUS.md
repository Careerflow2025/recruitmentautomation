# AI Smart Paste Feature - Status Report

## ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Ready to Use!

### For CANDIDATES (Already Implemented in UI):

**Location**: Candidates page → Click "🤖 AI Smart Paste" button

**How it works**:
1. User pastes messy WhatsApp/email text with candidate info
2. Click "✨ Extract & Add Candidates" button
3. Claude AI (Haiku model) parses the text intelligently
4. Automatically adds all extracted candidates to database
5. Each candidate gets `user_id` assigned (multi-tenant safe)

**Example Input** (messy text):
```
298697 Dental Receptionist CR0 8JD 7723610278
Part time £14 2-3 days/week
Start from October any days travel 5-10 miles
Added by AA 26/9/25

299043 Dentist HA8 0NN 07890123456
Full time £500/day Mon-Fri GDC registered
```

**AI Extracts**:
- ID, role, postcode, phone, salary, days
- Normalizes roles (e.g., "dn" → "Dental Nurse")
- Formats phone (adds leading 0)
- Formats salary (adds £ symbol)
- Puts extra info in notes

**Database Fields Populated**:
```javascript
{
  id: "298697",
  first_name: "",  // Optional
  last_name: "",   // Optional
  email: "",       // Optional
  phone: "07723610278",
  role: "Dental Receptionist",
  postcode: "CR0 8JD",
  salary: "£14",
  days: "2-3 days/week",
  experience: "",
  notes: "Part time, start from October, any days, travel 5-10 miles, added by AA on 26/9/25",
  user_id: "<current_user_id>",  // ✅ Auto-assigned
  added_at: "2025-10-02T..."
}
```

---

### For CLIENTS (API Ready, UI Integration Pending):

**API Endpoint**: `/api/ai/parse-client` ✅ Working
**Service**: `parseClients()` in `ai-service.ts` ✅ Working

**How it works** (when UI added):
1. User pastes messy text with client/surgery info
2. Claude AI parses intelligently
3. Adds to database via `/api/clients/add` endpoint
4. Auto-assigns `user_id`

**Example Input**:
```
CL001 Smile Dental Practice needs Dental Nurse
SW1A 1AA £15-17/hour Mon-Fri
GDC registered ASAP start near station
```

**AI Extracts**:
```javascript
{
  id: "CL001",
  surgery: "Smile Dental Practice",
  role: "Dental Nurse",
  postcode: "SW1A 1AA",
  pay: "£15-17",
  days: "Mon-Fri",
  requirement: "GDC registered",
  notes: "ASAP start, near station",
  system: "",     // Optional
  user_id: "<current_user_id>",  // ✅ Auto-assigned
  added_at: "2025-10-02T..."
}
```

## AI Capabilities:

### ✅ Handles Messy Data:
- WhatsApp copy-paste with line breaks
- Email forwards with headers
- Mixed formatting
- Missing fields (uses empty string)
- Typos and abbreviations

### ✅ Smart Normalization:
- **Roles**: "dn" → "Dental Nurse", "dt" → "Dentist", etc.
- **Phone**: 7723610278 → 07723610278
- **Salary**: "14" → "£14", "15-17" → "£15-17"
- **Postcodes**: Extracts UK format (CR0 8JD, HA8 0NN, etc.)

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Safe:
- Every candidate/client gets `user_id` from authenticated session
- RLS policies ensure data isolation
- Works perfectly with the multi-tenant system

## Testing the Feature:

### For Candidates (Try Now!):
1. Go to http://localhost:3010/candidates

### For Clients (API Ready):
Currently the clients page doesn't have the UI button yet, but the backend API works:

**Test via API**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/ai/parse-client \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "CL001 Smile Dental needs Dental Nurse SW1A 1AA £15-17/hour Mon-Fri GDC registered"}'
```
