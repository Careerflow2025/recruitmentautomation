## 🎯 Summary

### User Has (AI Doesn't)
1. ❌ **Export to CSV** - candidates, clients, matches
2. ❌ **View dashboard** - visual stats page
3. ❌ **Advanced filtering** - complex UI filter combinations
4. ❌ **List banned matches** - dedicated action to retrieve all banned

### AI Has (User Doesn't)
1. ✅ **Natural language** - understand messy prompts (ENHANCED with NLU)
2. ✅ **Smart parsing** - extract data from unstructured text
3. ✅ **Detailed analytics** - comprehensive statistics
4. ✅ **Batch processing** - chunked operations for large datasets
5. ✅ **Conversational** - ask questions and get explanations
6. ✅ **Context memory** - RAG system remembers everything
7. ✅ **Proactive suggestions** - recommends actions
8. ✅ **Multi-turn dialogue** - maintains conversation context
9. ✅ **Typo tolerance** - corrects spelling mistakes automatically
10. ✅ **Entity extraction** - pulls IDs, names, roles from any format
11. ✅ **Contextual pronouns** - "delete him" resolves to CAN015
12. ✅ **Multi-intent handling** - "add Sarah then show matches"
13. ✅ **Safety checks** - asks before destructive actions

### Overlapping Capabilities (Both Have)
1. ✅ Add/Edit/Delete candidates and clients
2. ✅ Ban/Unban matches
3. ✅ Regenerate matches
4. ✅ Update match status
5. ✅ Add notes
6. ✅ Bulk operations

## 🎓 AI Capabilities Documentation

### Natural Language Understanding (ENHANCED)
Mistral 7B with advanced NLU can:
- **Parse incomplete prompts** - "add john croydon" → asks for role
- **Infer missing information** - "sw1" → SW1A 1AA, "croydon" → CR0 1PB
- **Ask clarifying questions** - "delete the bad ones" → asks which IDs
- **Handle typos and grammatical errors** - "denta nurss" → Dental Nurse
- **Understand context from previous messages** - "delete him" → CAN015
- **Extract structured data from unstructured text** - "john 07700123456 dn cr0" → add_candidate
- **Correct abbreviations** - "dn" → Dental Nurse, "dt" → Dentist
- **Normalize formats** - "07700 900 000" → "07700900000"
- **Resolve pronouns** - "ban all his matches" → CAN015's matches
- **Multi-intent execution** - "add Sarah then show matches" → sequential
- **Informal language** - "gimme csv" → export, "nuke" → delete
- **Safety checks** - Confirms destructive actions before executing

### Multi-turn Dialogue
- Remembers conversation history (RAG system)
- Maintains context across turns
- References previous answers
- Builds on prior information
- Handles topic switches gracefully

### Smart Data Processing
- Extracts names from emails (john.smith@email.com → John Smith)
- Parses UK postcodes from text
- Normalizes phone numbers
- Identifies duplicate candidates
- Organizes messy CSV/text data

### Batch Processing
- Handles large datasets (100+ items)
- Chunks operations to avoid timeouts
- Provides progress updates
- Recovers from partial failures
- Auto-generates IDs for new items
