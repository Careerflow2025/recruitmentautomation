# Bulk Upload Test Instructions

## Problem Identified:
The server logs show "Found 1 rows in Excel file" when you uploaded.
This means your Excel file only has 1 data row, not 10.

## How to Fix:

### Option 1: Download Fresh Template
1. Go to http://localhost:3005/candidates
2. Click "ðŸ“¥ Download Template"
3. Open the downloaded `candidates_template.xlsx`
4. You should see:
   - Row 1: Headers (ID, Role, Postcode, Salary, Days, Phone, Notes, Experience, Travel Flexibility)
   - Row 2: ONE sample row with data

5. Keep Row 1 (headers) AS IS
6. Delete Row 2 (sample data)
7. Add your 10 candidates starting from Row 2

Example structure:
```
Row 1: ID | Role | Postcode | Salary | Days | Phone | Notes | Experience | Travel Flexibility
Row 2: CAN001 | Dentist | SW1A 1AA | Â£80k | 5 | 07700... | ... | ... | ...
Row 3: CAN002 | Nurse | SW1A 2BB | Â£30k | 5 | 07700... | ... | ... | ...
Row 4: CAN003 | Hygienist | SW1A 3CC | Â£40k | 4 | 07700... | ... | ... | ...
...
Row 11: CAN010 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
```

### Option 2: Check Your Current File
Open your Excel file and verify:
- Row 1 has the EXACT column names from the template
- Rows 2-11 have your 10 candidates
- All data is in the FIRST sheet (Sheet1)
- No merged cells
- No empty rows between data

### Critical Rules:
1. âœ… First row MUST be headers
2. âœ… All data in ONE sheet (the first sheet)
3. âœ… No gaps between rows
4. âœ… Postcode column must have values
5. âœ… Column names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)

### Test Upload:
After fixing your Excel:
1. Upload the file
2. You should see: "Successfully uploaded 10 candidates"
3. NOT "Successfully uploaded 1 candidates"

## If Still Not Working:
Send me a screenshot of your Excel file showing:
- The header row (Row 1)
- All 10 data rows (Rows 2-11)
- Make sure you're on Sheet1
